This repository contains projects for Udacity's [Business Analytics Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/business-analytics-nanodegree--nd098) 

This Nanodegree program is to gain foundational data skills applicable to any industry by collecting and analyzing data, modeling business scenarios, and communicating your findings with SQL, Excel, and Tableau.                                         

### [Introduction to Data Analysis]
Learn how to use statistics and visuals to find and communicate insights. Develop Excel skills to manipulate, analyze, and visualize data in a spreadsheet. Build Excel models to analyze possible business outcomes.

#### * Intro Project: [Interpret a Data Visualization](https://github.com/winniec228/Business-Analytics-Nanodegree-Project/blob/master/Interpret%20a%20Data%20Visualization/Project_Madrid%20in%20Detail.pdf) 
In this project, I explored an interactive data dashboard to uncover insights. Then I wrote a short report explaining each insight, and how I found the information to reach my conclusion from the dashboard.

#### * Project 1: [Analyze Survey Data](https://github.com/winniec228/Business-Analytics-Nanodegree-Project/blob/master/Interpret%20a%20Data%20Visualization/Analyze%20Udacity%20Survey%20Data.pdf)
In this project, I explored marketing suvery data from Udacity. Started with manipulating data with sort and filter, I summarized data with aggregation and conditional funtions. Then I built data visualizations for quantitative and categorical data with scatterplot, pie chart and histograms. 

### [SQL for Data Analysis]
Learn to use Structured Query Language (SQL) to extract and analyze data stored in databases.

#### * Project 2: [Query a Digital Music Store Database](https://github.com/winniec228/Business-Analytics-Nanodegree-Project/tree/master/SQL%20for%20Data%20Analysis)
  
In this project, I queried a digital music store database to answer more complex business questions by performing 
     
     • Basic SQL commands including SELECT,FROM, WHERE, and logical operators(LIKE, IN, NOT, AND & BETWEEN and OR)
     • Combining data tables using SQL joins
     • Aggregating data in SQL including COUNT, SUM, MIN, MAX and AVERAGE
     • Writing WHERE, GROUP BY, DISTINCT and HAVING 
     • Using Subquries 

This course also covers SQL funtions with DATE, CASE, POSION & STRPOS, CONCAT, CAST, COALESCE and window functions with PARTITION. 

### [Data Visualization]
Learn to apply design and visualization principles to create impactful data visualizations, build data dashboards, and tell stories with data.

#### * Project 3: [Build Data Dashboards](https://github.com/winniec228/Business-Analytics-Nanodegree-Project/tree/master/Data%20Visualization%20with%20Tableau)
Using US Census Demographic Data from a Kaggle dataset (the census data for all counties in 2015), I built data visualizations in Tableau by 

    • Using data hierarchies, filters, groups, sets, and calculated fields
    • Creating map-based data visualizations
    • Building interactive Tableau dashboards
    • Telling impactful stories using data
